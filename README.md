## MetroGnome Application: A Click Track Generator

The android application component for: https://github.com/EliGrosman/MetroGnome

A tool which detects beats in a song and plays a metronome in sync with the
recording of the song.

The web version demo may be found at http://server.triangleuw.com:5000

## Background

One of the most popular tools for practicing music is a metronome but sometimes
metronome apps are difficult to use and lack customizability. Additionally,
if a musician wanted to play along to a recording of a song and listen to a
metronome simultaneously, they would first have to find the exact tempo of the 
song and manage to start the metronome and recording perfectly in sync. This
is often extremely difficult. This project seeks to provide a solution to
this problem through an app that handles playing music from the user's device
and a fully customizable metronome at the same time.
